# cafeapp_v2 or Robusta

This project came from a person need to always find the best coffee shops! I love to find independant Cafés when I go away travelling or visit a new place. Google Maps doesn't provide the best experience for this as it focuses on everything and not the niche coffee culture.

This project also allowed me to explore my UX design skills that I often use but really get to practice in my day job as a Product Manager.

From a technical skills perspective it allowed me to develop my understanding of the following technologies:
- Flutter Apps
- Supabase APIs
- Secure Login OAuth2
- Database Queries pgsql
- Supabase Edge Functions
  


PENDING: You will find the Robusta app on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store as soon as it is released!

## Loyalty Screen
Theses Screens outline the loyalty feature of the application. This allows users to collect loyalty card points and for a Cafe to scan them and claim a coffee. As currently many cafes use paper loyalty cards. These think 1 for the plantet and reduce this where possible.
